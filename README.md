# azgra C++  library

azgra C++ library was originally part [another project](https://code.it4i.cz/mor0146/data_project) of mine. 
I decided to separate this library so I can use it other projects.

You will not find anything `extra` in this library as I am learning while writing it.
Most of the tools are here to simplify my life and are used in school projects.

### Build
- This library is targeted to be build with gcc 7 and newer
- C++17 is required

### Dependencies
- Boost filesystem (*will be replaced with C++ standard filesystem library*)
- Boost locale (*UTF-8 support*)
